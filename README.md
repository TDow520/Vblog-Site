This site currently has video place holders that will be switched out using API calls to Youtube at a later time.  There will also be a library that will hold previous videos. The videos will eventually be stored on a database to be accessed without having to to use an API call. 

## How to access

To run this application fork this repo

once you make your own clone
- open the code in your editor preferrably VS code.
- open the terminal
- cd into the client folder
- run npm init -y to get the node modules folder
- run npm i or npm install to download all the required packages
```bash
cd client/
npm init -y
npm install
```

once all the dependencies are installed run this code
 ```bash
 npm run dev
 ```
 
 This will bring up the site on your localhost port. The videos will be brought in later but they are too big to be hosted in github
