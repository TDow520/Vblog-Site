                    Butterfly and Bee are two friends who love to play video
                    games. They are both very good at the games they play. They
                    are also very good at making videos of their gameplay. They
                    are so good at making videos that they decided to make a
                    website to share their videos with the world. They hope you
                    enjoy their videos.
